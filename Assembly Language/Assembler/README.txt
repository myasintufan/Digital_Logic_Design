This codes is for step 1.
Let's descripte the code a little bit,
if there is a input file, code will operate otherwise not operate
it is not important that a output file is exist or not
if there is no output file, the code open a file called output.txt and print the result of transaction.
Otherwise, if there is a output file, the code use the file, if the file is full,delete the file contents
and then print the result of transaction.
