CSE 315 DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN TERM PROJECT
General Info
You are expected to design and implement a processor which supports instruction set: (AND,OR, ADD, LD, ST, ANDI, ORI, ADDI, XOR, XORI, JUMP, BEQ, BGT, BLT, BGE, BLE). Processor will have18 bits address width and 18 bits data width. Processor will have 5 parts as follows. Register File willhold register values and signal to write into any register. There will be  16 registers  in processor.Instruction Memory will be a read-only memory and instructions will be stored in this component. Ifthe   current  instruction  is  not  one   of   the   J,BR;  the   next  instruction  will   be   fetched  and  executedconsecutively from this memory.  Data Memory  will be  read-write memory  which will store data.Program  will be able to read data from  data memory, and also store data to this memory.  DataMemory will have  10 bits address width, and 18 bits data width. Control Unit  will produce propersignals to all datapath components. For example if the instruction is ST, control unit should producememWrite signal which will allow Data Memory component to write data value on its data input tothe address on its address input.  Arithmetic Logic Unit  (ALU) will compute arithmetic operationsADD,OR,XOR,AND,ADDI,ORI,XORI,ANDI. Operands will be fetched from register+register or register+immediate   value.   Result   will   be   stored   to   the  Register  File.  Control   unit   should   produce   propersignals to  ALU  according to instruction  opcode (Every instruction should have distinct operationalcode). 
Design Guide
Since you already have your instructions and instruction length(18 bits), your designprocess   includes;   instruction   set   architecture   and   control   unit   design.   For   instruction   setarchitecture you should decide on fields of your instruction like, what will be size of opcodefield? How many bits to reserve for register addressing in instruction? What is the maximumpossible size for immediate part? Control unit design will include proper signal generation forall   datapath.   First,   you  must  define   a   Finite   State   Machine   for   your   processor   (Micro-programmed   control   unit   is   not   allowed!).   For   every   instruction   you   should   decide,  Howmany states an instruction will need to execute? What will be the control signals for eachstate of an instruction ?
Assembly Language 
You should first design your instruction set architecture(ISA). Draw your ISA to thepaper by hand or by any schematic tool. When the details are clear about your processor,you can write an assembler to produce machine code input for your processor. Assemblerwill convert given mnemonics to the binary codes. You can use any programming language.In assembly language refer registers as R0,R1... R15.
Logisim Design
You are required to design your processor on Logisim software. Since there will bedifferent designs, you are responsible for preparing test inputs for your own processor. Youare   expected   to   write   an   assembly   code   with   all   instructions   defined   above.   Then,   yourassembler will convert assembly code to machine code which will be input for your logisimdesign.   You   can   load   this   machine   code   to   the   Instruction   Memory   by   right   clicking   onMemory component on Logisim software.
Verilog Design 
You   are   required   to   design   your   processor   on   Verilog   HDL   as   final   part.   Eachcomponent in your design should be defined as a module in Verilog HDL. Your assemblersmachine   code   output   will   be   input   for   your   Verilog   design.   You   are   responsible   forgenerating test instructions,testing debugging your design on ModelSim software.
